# Official TriggerFS Repository

## Welcome to the official TriggerFS github repository (https://triggerfs.io)
### A SaaS Application for a distributed, realtime message passing and trigger system.


This repository is made of three branches:
* cli
* client
* worker

Each of these branches holds the corresponding binary module.

Every module makes use of the configuration toml file.
In the master branch you will find a skeleton of such a configuration file.
